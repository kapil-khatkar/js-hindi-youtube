// Default JS behaviour
// => JS is Synchronous 
// => JS is Signle Threaded

// Execution Context
// ->execute one line of code at a time(i.e. line by line)
// -> log 1 -> 1 then,
// -> log 2 -> 2
// each operation waits for the last one to complete before executing
// Call stack   // Memory heap

// browser dont have power to read files
// [NodeJS have file system access]

     //__Blocking Code  vs Non-Blocking Code
// [blocking code ->block the flow of program]
// [read file sync]

// non-blocking code ->does not block execution
// read file Async
